Description: An approach to the visualization, analysis, and interpretation of 
  (microbial) community composition data, especially those originating from 
  amplicon sequencing. Analysis techniques include constrained and unconstrained
  ordination and visualizing taxonomic abundances and spatial patterns, among 
  others. Methods intended to assist bioinformaticians and ecologists in 
  selecting read trimming by quality scores and preprocessing/denoising of 
  datasets are also provided.
